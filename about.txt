Bart's Curse Toy is my first Android app. It is a simple soundboard
inspired by an old school Simpsons episode ("Lisa the Greek", Season 3).

It uses OnClickListeners to play sound clips when you press corresponding buttons.
The layout is a bit rough and I'm not sure how it will render on every phone,
but at least the buttons work. 

Source folder contains my source Java, XML and png/mp3 files.

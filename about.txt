Bart's Curse Toy is my first Android app. It is a simple soundboard
inspired by an old school Simpsons episode ("Lisa the Greek", Season 3).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It uses OnClickListeners to play sound clips when you press corresponding buttons.
The layout is a bit rough and I'm not sure how it will render on every phone,
but at least the buttons work. 

Can be installed on any Android by downloading .apk file and using a file manager 
to install. 

Source folder contains my source Java, XML and png/mp3 files.
